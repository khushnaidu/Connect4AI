## Description
This is a game of Connect 4. The game is played by two players, each with a different color. The players take turns dropping a piece of their color into one of the columns. The piece falls to the lowest available spot in the column. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board fills up before either player wins, the game is a draw.
